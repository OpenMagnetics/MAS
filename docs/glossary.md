# MAS Glossary

> **Informative.** This glossary defines the terms used across the MAS
> JSON Schema and its accompanying documents. It is a reading aid; the
> normative definitions are the schema `description` fields and the
> standards mapping in [`normative-references.md`](normative-references.md).
> Where a term has a citation in the IEC International
> Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV) or another standard, the reference
> follows the definition in parentheses.

Field names are written in `camelCase` to match the schema; concept
names that are not literal property keys are written in plain prose.
